            <p>My father did his best to fill the void left by my mother passing. He worked hard to provide and support for me and for my siblings, </p>
            <p>and he tried to be both a mother and a father to me and to my siblings. But despite his best efforts, he couldn't replace the warmth and love that their mother had provide</p>
